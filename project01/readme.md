# Project 01. Simple Boolean Algebra

## Instructions
- You need to implement the functions given in the source code. You may not use operators such as `&`, `|`, `!`, etc.
- You may only use `bit_t nand(bit_t a, bit_t b)` function, or the functions created in the source code to implement other functions.
- You may introduce additional `bit_t` variables to implement the functions.
- You may not use any flow control codes (ex `if`, `for`, `while`, etc.).
